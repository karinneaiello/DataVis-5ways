# Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

## R + ggplot2
![r](img/r_img.png)

- Write a paragraph for each visualization tool you use. What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?

- Description of the Technical achievements you attempted with this visualization.
  - Some ideas include interaction, such as mousing over to see more detail about the point selected.
- Description of the Design achievements you attempted with this visualization.
  - Some ideas include consistent color choice, font choice, element size (e.g. the size of the circles).


## d3 + HTML + JavaScript

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.
